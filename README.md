# Python Graph-Grammar UI for 2D Modelling

This repository hosts the code and example productions of the implementation of
a graph grammar UI as described in the CESCG 2019 Paper "A Graph Grammar for 
Modelling of 2D Shapes".

The example grammar definitions from the paper can be found in the folder [cescg_2019_examples](https://github.com/D4id4los/Python-Graphs/tree/master/cescg_2019_examples).
